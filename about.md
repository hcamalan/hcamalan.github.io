My name is Hüseyin, and I'm a recent graduate of the MSc Computational Neuroscience program organized by BCCN Berlin and Technische Universität Berlin. Before that, I finished a BA in Psychology at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, where I grew up.

I take pride in having a broad range of interests, and this is not an exaggeration by any means (just ask anyone who personally knows me!). Specifically, social dancing (forró), powerlifting and ultimate frisbee have kept me captivated for a very long time and in some of these I have enjoyed a relatively high level of competence. Additionally, since the coronavirus outbreak, I have been making the best out of my time at home, experimenting with coffee and baking.

If you're interested, feel free to take a look at [my CV](/assets/CV_Huseyin_Camalan.pdf) or [my previous work](/projects).
