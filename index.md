Welcome to my personal website.

In early 2020, I graduated with a MSc degree in Computational Neuroscience, organized jointly by [BCCN Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/) and [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/). I am currently working as a Technology Consulting Analyst at Accenture.

You can find a longer summary in the [about](/about) page, take a look at my [CV](/assets/CV_Huseyin_Camalan.pdf), or browse through my [previous projects](/projects).
