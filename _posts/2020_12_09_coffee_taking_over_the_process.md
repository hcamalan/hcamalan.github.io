# Coffee - taking over the process

It is safe to say that a large part of the comfort that we enjoy in our lives is owed to some processes associated with industrialization. For example, specialization in occupations allows us to further our domain of knowledge and produce gradually better products. Streamlining processes allows us to mass produce, which increase the supply of commodities that feed us, clean us, and improve our lives in other ways. Machinery inside our homes clear up vast amounts of valuable time that we can then use to specialize in even other things. 

In a way, making the everyday hassle efficient is probably the biggest contributor to our flourishment. Non-homo primates spend hours and hours chewing on and digesting food just to be able to survive. Humans speed that up by an order of magnitude by cooking food; though historically they still had to spend lots of time obtain food supplies; whether by hunting, collecting or producing it. This time requirement was further reduced by another order of magnitude post-industrialization; with food being mass-grown, processed in factories, delivered to every corner of the world through some logistics black magic, and prepared further into a meal ready to eat. This makes the most challenging thing about sustaining ourselves literally putting the food in our mouth with a fork and chewing it.

Needless to say, things sometimes go terribly wrong when these concepts are blindly applied to everything. In this post I will talk about the specific case of coffee, but feel free to apply it to any appropriate specific commodity/service you observe in the capitalist system.

*Instead of making coffee, use our specially prepared capsule in which we made coffee and add it into our special machine which adds hot water, which by the way costs €100*

Though the case of Nespresso is a very obvious offender, my frustrations with the coffee industry has many different sources, from the mass-producing giants to up-and-coming fancy third-wave coffee movement. The end result is a losing choice that is forced on the masses: either pay up to have good coffee or settle with stale, badly processed coffee. Therefore this jumbled essay is my call to the reader to take over the process in whatever degree they can.

Before I begin airing my condolences, let's talk about coffee and what good coffee is. Coffee can be called anything from the plants of genus Coffea, the beans of said plants, the crushed powder of said beans, or the soup of the said powder.

![Coffee cupping image]Yes, soup - you read that right

While good coffee is a very subjective term, I think it is safe to say that it has some characteristics everyone would agree upon: freshness and wellness of the preparation. For example, if we were to consider that one of my aunts thinks that Nescafe powder is good coffee (actually a true story), we wouldn't have much of an issue agreeing on the fact that she would appreciate that Nescafe even more when the Nescafe jar is freshly opened and prepared well (freshly-boiled good quality water, appropriate strength, etc.). We will delve further into these definitions later, but that's literally it. Freshness and appropriate preparation.

And this is where the problems start to begin. More specifically speaking, looking at the coffee industry as a whole, freshness is extremely underrated and preparation is extremely overrated. 

Let's begin with freshness. As a general rule, most coffee that is consumed around the world is already stale at the moment of being sold, or about to go stale. Dried but unroasted coffee beans are said to preserve their aroma for up to a year, roasted coffee beans up to a month, and grinded coffee powder pretty much in a matter of hours. 

Thus, your supermarket's shelf full of coffee - yep, no good is coming from any of that. That coffee has been roasted a long time (over a month and under a year would be my best estimate) ago. This is doubly true for the pre-ground packaging. You might get good coffee for the first few times, but you will soon realize that there's not much in terms of aroma in your cup as time goes on. This is true even for the more premium supermarkets. Next time you're in your supermarket, check for roast date on any of the coffee packages you see - you won't find any.

What's really infuriating about this is the extent to which we are forced to drink stale coffee. Let's look at some numbers. Humanity collectively produced 10 billion tons of coffee in 2018-2019 - 6 billion tons of the arabica (the more delicate and valuable crop) plus 4 billion tons of robusta (a more durable species that is used in cheaper products). Considering that there are ~5.8 billion people over 15 on the earth right now, that averages to nearly 2 kilograms of raw coffee beans per person. That's a lot of coffee! And a significant chunk of that is wasted by premature roasting, going stale in a dark storage somewhere.

So let's say you swore off buying your coffee from the supermarket and decided to buy third-wave. You go into the edgily-named roaster/cafe in the gentrified part of your neighborhood and get yourself a pack of premium arabica seeds hand-roasted by experts. Even here the coffee is likely to be roasted up to a month before (which is our limit, remember), up to three to five times the price. Here you are paying a premium for the quality of the beans, but most of your money is actually going towards the wage of the roaster/profits of the cafe.

To consider more concrete numbers: currently in Germany, a kilo of cheap coffee beans cost around 8-12€/kg in a supermarket. In third-wave roasters this price will go around €30/kg, and go higher depending on the coffee variety. Raw beans, on the other hand, seem to cost about half the price of the same beans roasted in a third-wave shop (a bit more considering that some weight is lost during roasting).

Here is where an attentive reader would say: if freshness is so important yet so hard to achieve, why don't we just roast our own coffee beans?

And this is an extremely crucial point. It is a brilliant question, but somehow the question is automatically answered in our heads: roasting is a specialized craft where precise industrial machinery must be used by people who devout years of their life obtaining special domain knowledge. And this notion is reinforced through and through on whatever medium it is discussed, through coffee professionals and many hobbyists alike.

The reality is that things weren't always like that. My mother remembers her childhood, in which she and her siblings would make Turkish coffee on their father's demand, by roasting a small amount of fresh beans over open fire, grinding them and preparing them. And the cultures where coffee originated from seem to still operate in a similar way, with e.g. coffee roasting being a part of coffee ceremonies in Ethiopia.

So, to answer the hypothetical question above: yes, you can roast your own coffee beans. And no, you don't necessarily need special equipment for it despite how many people will tell you, which is related to the second issue, that is the overratedness of equipment.

Overrating of preparation

Let me first state that I am by no means scoffing at proper preparation. Every single brewing method has its relevant variables and changing those variables will change results.

What I specifically mean here is that we don't necessarily need special equipment to make coffee that is pleasant. We don't need espresso machines, brewing kettles, smart drippers, coffee siphons, plastic coffee syringes. Making this more controversial, we don't need grinders, or roasting equipment. None of these things are necessarily bad - in many cases they are very ingenuine solutions and they help us produce extremely good coffee. However, they are all secondary. The primary requirement to making a good coffee is having freshly roasted, high quality coffee, good water and some way to apply heat.

And from here we go into two different routes of frenzy. The first one is where giants like Nestle create the next amazing and convenient coffee capsule machine and market it as the new practical way to make espresso. Once you buy the machine you basically have to buy capsules, otherwise your initial investment in the machine is wasted. Conveniently (for them), the capsules are expensive (the cost is essentially comparable to buying and preparing third-wave shop coffee beans).

The second one is where every new fancy coffee toy is marketed as things that will finally elevate your coffee game to the highest level. These things cost an arm and a leg and are only accessible in general to the middle/upper-class in the western world. They are all the hype in coffee forums over the internet, and youtube coffee celebrities do fancy edits with 4k shots to water viewers' mouths about the new PID-controlled smart kettle that pours hot water at a specified temp and pouring speed. What makes matters worse is that other companies then step in to make cheaper versions of the same equipment, sometimes even resorting to making knockoffs; except the knockoffs don't perform well and then we have a waste problem in our hands as well.

In the end we are stuck where the rich people can either buy expensive equipment or simply keep paying cafes and baristas, while poor people are left with no choices and no good, constructive advice they can begin their coffee journey on. And this one hits me hard. I was a student until recently and never read anywhere


 I am from a developing country with an ailing economy (Turkey), and I just guided a friend of mine to buy their first hand grinder and it was a huge investment for them. It sounds funny but this is no joke - buying something so simple as an aeropress is simply not justifiable. And other countries with similar or even worse purchasing power are a dime a dozen. Even in the first-world, many people are living paycheck to paycheck and simply can not afford to buy things like that. But they deserve to enjoy coffee just the same and if they made the choice to get into coffee, we should have better advice than
